# sunset-time

I'm going to use API technology that I'm able to create an ISS tracker.
This is the international space station and it floats high above in the sky and it circles earth many, many times a day.

And I'm going to try and track where the ISS is currently at in the sky. And at the time point when the ISS is in the night sky, right above where I am, 
then I'm going to send ourselves an email telling me to look up and spot the fast-moving ISS.
